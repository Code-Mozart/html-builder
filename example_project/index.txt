\large HTML Builder
\medium What is this?
This application reads hypertext files and generates
html pages of them.
Why make a converter from one hypertext
language to another?
Because html doesn't allow reusing hypertext through references.
Goals of this HTML Builder include...
\list
...allowing repeating hypertext to be reused.
...provide an easier syntax to markup text
...shared meta information
...simple notation for newlines
...source code integration
\end

\medium Project structure
A HTML Builder project consists of the following files:
\list(block)
\bold Content files
Content files are the core of the website definition and therefore
of the HTML Builder project.
They contain the text and other contents that get displayed
on the website

\bold Style files
Those define the style (layout, design) of the website.

\bold Manifest file
This file specifies what the different files in the project mean
and how they're put together

\bold Project File
This file is always called \style("code", "\".htmlbuilder\"") .
It represents the project and can be used to load it
into the application. This file should not manually be modified
and should be modified indirectly through the application.
